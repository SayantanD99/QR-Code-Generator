# QR-Code-Generator
This project is a simple command-line QR code generator that allows users to input a URL and then generates a corresponding QR code image. The generated QR code is saved as a PNG image, and the entered URL is saved in a text file for future reference.

# Dependencies:

- Inquirer: The inquirer npm package is used to prompt the user for input in the command-line interface.
- qr-image: The qr-image npm package is used to convert the user-entered URL into a QR code image.
- fs: The fs native node module is used for file system operations, such as creating and writing to text files.
